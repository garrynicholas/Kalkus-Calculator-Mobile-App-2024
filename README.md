# Kalkus 2024 [Calculator Mobile App]
This project is a Calculator Mobile App developed using the Flutter framework in 2024. The motivation behind this project stems from my experience during my final exams in high school. We were given a choice of four projects: Calculator, Cashier, Gallery Photos, and Library Management. Due to other commitments such as tutoring for SNBT (Exam to get into Top Universities), school studies, and homework, I had only each weekend to complete this project. I chose the calculator project and aimed to include more features beyond a simple calculator, such as Length, Time, Data, and Mass calculations.
